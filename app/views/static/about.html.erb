<h1>About BlackOpsWiki:</h1>
<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
<p>Reviewing the police killings involving Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and many other more recent, less publicized cases, it is clear that we have a problem in this country when it comes to the relationship between law enforcement and citizens of color.</p>

<p>In the most egregious of these cases, especially where there is irrefutable, public documentation of police abuses in the form of video or audio recordings, we have often seen protests, violence and a spate of news stories. However, usually within a few weeks of the incident, public interest fatigues, the story fades from public discourse. Until the next video or recording surfaces and the process repeats itself. This pattern will not correct on its own.  It will repeat until someone stops it.</p>

<p>BlackOpsWiki is singularly devoted to ending the indiscriminant killing of frican Americans and other people of color by the police.</p>

<h3>The First Essential Step</h3>
<p>At BlackOpsWiki, we believe the first essential step in addressing this issue is to inventory the problem. At it's core, BlackOpsWiki will serve as a crowd-sourced repository of cases of killings and/or abuse of people of color by law enforcement. Our goal is to be a common source of information and a mirror to the rest of America, keeping these cases in the forefront of our collective consciousness.</p>

<p>Having the repository in place, will allow us to extend the lives of these victims beyond the two-week attention span of the mainstream media to the purpose of enabling us to organize a collective response politically or otherwise.</p>

<h3>How You Can Help:</h3>
<p>Most importantly, our goal is to be a comprehensive resource for Information, Organization and Action in these cases.  In that effort, volunteer editors do all the work of compiling and editing the data on this site. <%= link_to 'Guidelines for Volunteer Editors', guidelines_path %></p>
<p>In addition, we rely on donations to fund our hosting, and other technology requirements.  Please contact us at blackopswiki0@gmail.com, if you want to help us financially.</p>
